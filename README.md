TensorRT: Accelerates deep learning inference.
Metadata Management: Manages detection and recognition data.
Integration Workflow
Camera feed captured via GStreamer pipeline.
Iris detection and segmentation using TensorRT-accelerated models.
Metadata extraction and processing for identity verification.
Usage
Starting the Application
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
Click Start Camera to initialize the live feed.
Use the Start Iris Scan button for verification.
API Endpoints
/start_scan
Method: POST
Description: Processes the iris scan and returns verification results.
